    <h1>Introducing Go</h1>    

    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Go is a programming language design started in 2007 and developed as open source in Google
            by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer in 2009. Version 1.0 was released by Google in 2012
            and as of early 2018 it had reached version 1.9.3
        </li>
        
        <li>In the world of computer science, both Ken Thompson and Rob Pikes had been highly renowned
            for their works at the prestigious Bell Labs, before joining Google. Ken Thompson designed
            the original Unix operating system and created B, the predecessor to the present day legendary 
            C pogramming language. Rob Pike was the member of the Bell Labs' Unix team. He and Ken Thompson
            collaborated to create the original design of UTF-8 encoding as defined by Unicode standards.
            Their UTF-8 encoding system is backward-compatible with ASCII and has been dominant in character 
            encoding for World Wide Web since 2009.

        <li>
        The three inventors of Golang mentioned their shared dislikes for the overly complicated C++ as one
        of the main reason prompting  them to design  the new programming language.<br> 
        <em>ref:<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go_(programming_language)&oldid=822810173">Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia</a></em>       
        </li>
     
        <li>
        Go is also known as Golang and according to its official website at Golang.org,
        "Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is strongly typed and
        garbage-collected and has explicit support for concurrent programming."<br>
        <em>ref: <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">https://golang.org/ref/spec</a></em>>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Balbaert(2012) mentioned that Golang was created for ease of programming, fast compilation and execution.<br>
        <em>ref: Balbaert, I.: The way to Go: A thorough introduction to the Go programming language. iUniverse, USA (2012)</em>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        From my understanding, the language offers a concise alternative to object orientation methodology
        and yet, it presents a powerful approach to program scalable and natively concurrent codes.
        Golang seems to be designed to harness the power of parallel processing enabled by multicore CPUs with
        the earliest generations of were only available to the general public from 2005/2006 onwards.
        Probably, the inventors wanted to create a language which is modern and powerful, but at the same time
        more streamlined and less complexed than C++. Created shortly after the first availabilty of multicore
        processing to the general public, they must had designed Golang with concurrency in mind. In comparison to
        older, pre-multicore, enterprise grade languages, Golang is expected to run much cheaper multiple processes 
        and deliver much better scalability
