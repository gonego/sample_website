    <li>Go is a programming language design started in 2007 and developed as open source in Google <br>
        by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer in 2009. Version 1.0 was released by Google in 2012<br>
        and as of early 2018 it had reached version 1.9.3<br>
    </li>
    <li>In the world of computer science, both Ken Thompson and Rob Pikes had been highly renowned<br> 
        for their works at the prestigious Bell Labs, before joining Google. Ken Thompson designed <br>
        the original Unix operating system and created B, the predecessor to the present day legendary<br> 
        C pogramming language. Rob Pike was the member of the Bell Labs' Unix team. He and Ken Thompson<br>
        collaborated to create the original design of UTF-8 encoding as defined by Unicode standards.<br>
        Their UTF-8 encoding system is backward-compatible with ASCII and has been dominant in character<br> 
        encoding for World Wide Web since 2009.<br>

    The three inventors of Golang mentioned their shared dislikes for the overly complicated C++ as one<br>
    of the main reason prompting  them to design  the new programming language.<br>

    Go is also known as Golang and according to its official website at Golang.org,<br> 
    "Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is strongly typed and<br> 
    garbage-collected and has explicit support for concurrent programming."<br>
    source <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">https://golang.org/ref/spec</a><br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Balbaert(2012) mentioned that Golang was created for ease of programming, fast compilation and execution.<br>

    From my understanding, the language offers a concise alternative to object orientation methodology<br> 
    and yet, it presents a powerful approach to program scalable and natively concurrent codes.<br>
    This was designed to harness the power of parallel processing enabled by multicore CPUs which<br>
    first generations of were available to the general public back in 2005/2006.<br>
    Probably, the inventors wanted to create a language which is modern and powerful, but at the same time<br>
    more streamlined and less complexed than C++. Created shortly after the first availabilty of multicore<br>
    processing, they must had designed Golang with concurrency in mind.  Due to this, in comparison to<br>
    the older, pre-multicore languages, Golang is claimed to able to do a lot more multiple things at any<br> 
    one time. This capability in handling outstanding processing volume drives up the scalability of the<br>
    language.
