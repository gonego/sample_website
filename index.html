    <h1>Introducing Go</h1>    

    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Go is a programming language design started in 2007 and developed as open source in Google <br>
            by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer in 2009. Version 1.0 was released by Google in 2012<br>
            and as of early 2018 it had reached version 1.9.3<br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In the world of computer science, both Ken Thompson and Rob Pikes had been highly renowned<br> 
            for their works at the prestigious Bell Labs, before joining Google. Ken Thompson designed <br>
            the original Unix operating system and created B, the predecessor to the present day legendary<br> 
            C pogramming language. Rob Pike was the member of the Bell Labs' Unix team. He and Ken Thompson<br>
            collaborated to create the original design of UTF-8 encoding as defined by Unicode standards.<br>
            Their UTF-8 encoding system is backward-compatible with ASCII and has been dominant in character<br> 
            encoding for World Wide Web since 2009.<br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        The three inventors of Golang mentioned their shared dislikes for the overly complicated C++ as one<br>
        of the main reason prompting  them to design  the new programming language.<br> 
        <em>ref:<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go_(programming_language)&oldid=822810173">Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia</a></em><br>        
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Go is also known as Golang and according to its official website at Golang.org,<br> 
        "Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is strongly typed and<br> 
        garbage-collected and has explicit support for concurrent programming."<br>
        <em>ref: <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">https://golang.org/ref/spec</a></em>><br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        In his book, Balbaert(2012) mentioned that Golang was created for ease of programming, fast compilation and execution.<br> 
        <em>ref: Balbaert, I.: The way to Go: A thorough introduction to the Go programming language. iUniverse, USA (2012)</em><br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        From my understanding, the language offers a concise alternative to object orientation methodology<br> 
        and yet, it presents a powerful approach to program scalable and natively concurrent codes.<br>
        Golang seems to be designed to harness the power of parallel processing enabled by multicore CPUs with<br>
        the earliest generations of were only available to the general public from 2005/2006 onwards.<br>
        Probably, the inventors wanted to create a language which is modern and powerful, but at the same time<br>
        more streamlined and less complexed than C++. Created shortly after the first availabilty of multicore<br>
        processing to the general public, they must had designed Golang with concurrency in mind. In comparison to<br>
        older, pre-multicore, enterprise grade languages, Golang is expected to run much cheaper multiple processes<br> 
        and deliver much better scalability<br>
